"      <h3>What are jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"      jQuery selectors are one of the most important aspects of the jQuery "
"library. These selectors use familiar CSS syntax to allow page authors to "
"quickly and easily identify any set of page elements to operate upon with "
"the jQuery library methods. Understanding jQuery selectors is the key to "
"using the jQuery library most effectively. The selector is a string "
"expression that identifies the set of DOM elements that will be collected "
"into a matched set to be operated upon by the jQuery methods.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"      <h3>Types of jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>The \"Basic Selectors\" are known as \"find selectors\" as they are "
"used to find elements within the DOM. The \"Positional\" and \"Custom "
"Selectors\" are \"filter selectors\" as they filter a set of elements (which "
"defaults to the entire set of elements in the DOM). This extract will focus "
"on the basic selectors as they are most important and will cover most of "
"your needs.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4>Basic CSS Selectors</h4>\n"
"      <p>These selectors follow standard CSS3 syntax and semantics. For more "
"selectors and examples go to <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/category/"

"most of the time easier to configure than the options before and also more "
"powerful. But it has the disadvantage that the change of the size is not "
"send by an event but the defined elements are checked in a fix interval (see "
"below). So e.g. every 100ms a certain div is checked and if the size has "
"changed the iframe is resized.<br />If you only specify \"body\" then the "
"iframe does enlarge nicely but does not get smaller anymore. The best way to "
"configure this is to use the outermost element where the change can happen. "
"Please see example 26 for a working example. This feature does also trigger "
"all css/js modifications inside the iframe again! You can use the jQuery "
"syntax to specify the elements. Most likely the outermost div (e.g. #main, "
"#page, #wrap) is the one you need. This feature is also available in the "
"external workaround! There you can try #ai_wrapper_div as this very often is "
"rendered by the ai_external.js. This feature replaces \"Resize on click "
"events\" and \"Resize on AJAX events\" from the free version as it is more "
"powerful and easier to configure.  Shortcode attribute: "
